### Distributing Revenue

#### When to Distribute

Revenue can be distributed when:
- An aggregation has been completed
- The aggregation has revenue (ETH was sent when created)
- The aggregation hasn't been distributed yet
- You have permission to trigger distribution

#### Distribution Process

**Step 1: Click "Distribute Revenue"**

1. Find the **"Distribute Revenue"** button (top right of the card)
2. Click the button
3. A modal dialog appears

**Step 2: Select Aggregation**

In the modal:
- **Dropdown**: Shows all available aggregations
- **Format**: `Aggregation #X` with status indicators
- **Status indicators**:
  - ‚úÖ **"Available"**: Has revenue and can be distributed
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **"No Revenue"**: Aggregation has 0 ETH
  - ‚ùå **"Already Distributed"**: Revenue already distributed

**Step 3: Review Aggregation Info**

For each aggregation, you'll see:
- **Aggregation ID**: The aggregation number
- **Total Revenue**: ETH amount available
- **Status**: Whether it can be distributed
- **Revenue Distributed**: Amount already distributed (if any)

**Step 4: Confirm Distribution**

1. Select an aggregation with "Available" status
2. Review the revenue amount
3. Click **"Distribute Revenue"** button in the modal
4. **Wallet confirmation**: Approve the transaction
5. Wait for transaction confirmation

**Step 5: Distribution Complete**

After confirmation:
- ‚úÖ Success message appears
- ‚úÖ Revenue is automatically distributed to all contributors
- ‚úÖ Your share is calculated based on your contribution
- ‚úÖ Your "Total Revenue Earned" updates automatically
- ‚úÖ Modal closes automatically

### Understanding Distribution

**How Distribution Works**:

1. **Trigger**: Someone clicks "Distribute Revenue" for an aggregation
2. **Calculation**: Contract calculates each participant's share:
   - Based on signals used in aggregation
   - Weighted by signal weights
   - Proportional to total contributions
3. **Distribution**: ETH is sent to each contributor's wallet
4. **Platform Fee**: 5% goes to platform address
5. **Recording**: Distribution is recorded on-chain

**Your Share Calculation**:
```
Your Share = (Your Signals Used √ó Your Signal Weight) / 
             (Total Signals Used √ó Average Weight) √ó 
             (Total Revenue √ó 0.95)
```

**Example**:
- Aggregation used 4 signals total
- You contributed 2 signals (weight: 1 each)
- Total revenue: 0.1 ETH
- Your share: `(2 √ó 1) / (4 √ó 1) √ó (0.1 √ó 0.95) = 0.0475 ETH`

### Distribution Messages

**Success Messages**:
- ‚úÖ `"Revenue distributed successfully! Total: X ETH (Participants: Y ETH, Platform: Z ETH)"`
- Shows breakdown of distribution

**Warning Messages**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `"Distribution completed for Aggregation #X, but it had no revenue (0 ETH)"`
- Indicates the aggregation was created without sending ETH

**Error Messages**:
- ‚ùå `"Failed to distribute revenue: [error reason]"`
- Common reasons: Already distributed, invalid aggregation, contract error

### After Distribution

- Your revenue balance updates immediately
- You can see the distribution transaction on Etherscan
- Revenue appears in your wallet
- History table updates (when implemented)

## ‚ùì FAQ

### General Questions

#### Q1: What is the Encrypted Signal Sharing Pool?

**A**: It's a decentralized platform that allows traders to share and aggregate trading signals while maintaining complete privacy using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Signals are encrypted before leaving your device and remain encrypted throughout the aggregation process.

#### Q2: Why should I use this instead of regular signal sharing?

**A**: Traditional signal sharing exposes your trading strategy. This platform uses FHE to aggregate signals without revealing individual values, protecting your competitive advantage while still benefiting from collective intelligence.

#### Q3: Is this for production use or just testing?

**A**: Currently optimized for Sepolia testnet (testing). The technology is production-ready, but mainnet deployment requires additional configuration. Mock mode is for development/testing, while FHE mode demonstrates production capabilities.

### Technical Questions

#### Q4: Why do my signals show as encrypted (üîí)?

**A**: This is normal and expected! In FHE mode, signals are encrypted before being sent to the blockchain. The lock icon indicates your signal is protected. Only aggregation results are decrypted.

#### Q5: Can I view my submitted signal values later?

**A**: No. Once encrypted and submitted, individual signal values remain encrypted forever‚Äîeven you cannot view them. This is by design to ensure privacy. Only aggregation results are decrypted.

#### Q6: What's the difference between Mock and FHE mode?

**A**:
- **Mock Mode**: Signals stored in plaintext, fast, for testing only
- **FHE Mode**: Signals encrypted end-to-end, requires Gateway decryption, true privacy protection

#### Q7: How does Gateway decryption work?

**A**: When aggregations complete in FHE mode, results are encrypted. The Zama Gateway service decrypts the results asynchronously. You'll see a "Decrypting..." status until completion (usually 1-5 minutes).

### Usage Questions

#### Q8: How do I earn revenue?

**A**:
1. Submit high-quality signals
2. Your signals get selected for aggregations
3. When aggregations include revenue (ETH), you receive a share
4. Revenue is distributed automatically based on your contribution

#### Q9: How is my revenue share calculated?

**A**: Your share = (Your signals used √ó Your signal weight) / (Total signals √ó Average weight) √ó (Total revenue √ó 0.95). The remaining 5% goes to platform maintenance.

#### Q10: Can I use this on Ethereum mainnet?

**A**: Currently only Sepolia testnet is supported. Mainnet deployment requires:
- Deploying contracts to mainnet
- Configuring mainnet Gateway (if available)
- Updating frontend configuration
- More ETH for gas fees

### Problem Questions

#### Q11: Why isn't my aggregation showing results?

**A**: 
- **FHE Mode**: Wait for Gateway decryption (1-5 minutes)
- **Mock Mode**: Refresh the page or check transaction status
- **No signals selected**: Ensure you selected signals when creating aggregation
- **Network issues**: Check RPC connection

#### Q12: Why did my transaction fail?

**A**: Common reasons:
- **Insufficient gas**: Get more Sepolia ETH
- **Wrong network**: Switch to Sepolia
- **Invalid input**: Check signal IDs and values
- **Contract error**: Verify aggregation requirements are met

#### Q13: The page is blank/not loading

**A**:
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
5. Try different browser

### Privacy Questions

#### Q14: Who can see my trading signals?

**A**: Nobody. Signals are encrypted before leaving your device and remain encrypted on-chain. Only aggregation results (combinations of multiple signals) are decrypted, and even then, individual contributions cannot be determined.

#### Q15: Is my data stored on a server?

**A**: No. All data is stored on the Sepolia blockchain (decentralized). The application frontend runs in your browser, and encryption happens locally. No central server stores your signal values.

#### Q16: Can the platform administrators see my signals?

**A**: No. There are no administrators with special access. The smart contract processes encrypted data without decryption capability. Even if someone had admin access, they cannot decrypt your signals.

### Advanced Questions

#### Q17: How does FHE encryption work technically?

**A**: FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) allows computation on encrypted data without decryption. When you submit a signal, it's encrypted using Zama's FHE scheme. The smart contract performs arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication) on encrypted values. Only the final result is decrypted by Zama Gateway.

#### Q18: What happens if Zama Gateway is down?

**A**: Aggregation results will remain encrypted until Gateway is available. The data is safe on-chain. Once Gateway recovers, decryption requests are processed. For critical use cases, consider Gateway reliability or use Mock mode for immediate results.

#### Q19: Can I verify the encryption and aggregation myself?

**A**: Yes. Everything is on-chain and verifiable:
- Encryption proofs are stored with each signal
- Aggregation transactions are public
- Smart contract code is open source
- You can verify using blockchain explorers and contract ABIs

#### Q20: How do I switch between Mock and FHE modes?

**A**:
1. Go to Settings page
2. Find "FHE Encryption Mode" switch
3. Toggle the switch
4. Confirm in the modal
5. Page reloads with new mode
