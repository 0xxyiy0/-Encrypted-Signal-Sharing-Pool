00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to Encrypted Signal Sharing Pool!
A privacy-preserving trading signal aggregation platform on Zama FHEVM.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Imagine multiple trading bots or participants
securely sharing and aggregating trading signals without revealing individual strategies.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,500
Core values: Complete privacy protection using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
Signals are encrypted on your device and remain encrypted throughout.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Intelligent aggregation from multiple signal sources for more accurate market predictions.
Fair revenue distribution based on contributions, incentivizing high-quality signals.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Real-time monitoring with a visual dashboard to track aggregated results and earnings.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Project advantages one: Industry-leading privacy.
End-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge computation—only final aggregated results are decrypted.
Individual signals stay encrypted forever; strategies are untraceable.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Advantages two: Real business scenarios.
Trading signal aggregation, decentralized signal markets,
privacy-protected quant trading, institutional data collaboration.

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Advantages three: Technical innovations.
Dual-contract architecture: Mock version for quick testing, FHE version for production.
Gateway integration with timeout and retry mechanisms, progressive development.

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:05,000
Zama tech stack: Fully leveraging the FHEVM ecosystem.
Core library @fhevm/solidity provides FHE encrypted types like euint32,
supporting homomorphic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division on encrypted data.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Public decryption mechanism, Sepolia testnet configuration.
Applications: Store encrypted signals, perform mean or weighted average aggregations.

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,000
@fhevm/hardhat-plugin: Automatic contract compilation and network management.
@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk: Frontend encryption SDK—encrypt data in the browser,
generate proofs, upload only encrypted inputs.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,500
Zama Gateway: Asynchronous decryption service with polling to avoid blocking.
Enterprise-grade reliability for decrypting aggregated results for user viewing.

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Tech architecture advantages comparison:
Traditional schemes use plaintext storage and require decryption;
Our FHEVM offers end-to-end encryption, on-chain computation without trust, optimized performance.

15
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:44,000
System architecture: Frontend with React + Vite, including signal input, aggregation dashboard, revenue distribution.
Smart contracts: SignalPoolFHE.sol stores encrypted signals, performs FHE aggregation and revenue distribution.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,500
Mock version for testing. Data flow: User input encrypted and uploaded,
FHE computes encrypted results, Gateway decrypts and updates state for frontend display.

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,000
Revenue distribution based on contributions, users withdraw earnings.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Quick start: Clone the project, install dependencies, configure env vars like contract addresses and RPC.
Run dev server to experience it.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Features: End-to-end encryption, homomorphic computation, selective decryption.
Aggregation algorithms: Mean, weighted average, signal voting.
Revenue mechanisms: Contribution tracking, automatic allocation, transparent and auditable.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,500
User experience: Real-time monitoring, Echarts visualizations, responsive design.
Tech stack: Solidity 0.8.24, React 19.1, ethers.js, and more.

21
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Use cases: Trading signal aggregation, quant strategy collaboration,
institutional data collaboration, decentralized signal markets.

22
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Project highlights: Real business value, full technical implementation, excellent UX,
production-ready with error handling, comprehensive docs.
